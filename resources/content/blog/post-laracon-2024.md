Let me take you on a little journey, starting with my arrival in Dallas. This was my fourth Laracon—from taking the train in Chicago to navigating the subway in New York. But Dallas? Dallas had a different kind of excitement in store for me.

It all started when I landed at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and realized that Uber prices were through the roof—$70 just to get to my hotel! Being the frugal traveler that I am, I decided to take the train instead. After all, the train station was right there -- I've taken public transportation many times in NY/Chicago.. and for just $3? I could save a good chunk of change.

The ticket machine was cash-only, which is a rare sight in 2024. Luckily, I had some cash on me. I popped in a $20 bill for that $3 ticket and waited for my change. What happened next felt like I had just hit the jackpot at a casino—coins came pouring out of the machine, clinking and clanging, and suddenly I found myself holding $17 worth of coins, with more homeless folks around me than I'd expected.

So there I was, boarding the train with a bag full of coins, and 15 stops to go. The first stop came, and 75% of the passengers got off. I soon realized that was the "smart" stop, where locals hopped off to save money on their journey into the city. As the train approached downtown Dallas, the car grew emptier and the surroundings more... interesting. By the time I reached my final stop, I was the last person on the train, greeted by a throng of homeless people at the station. Let's just say, I quickly booked it to my hotel, and made sure to Uber around after that.

## The Beauty of the Community

Despite the eventful journey, Laracon 2024 was more than worth it. The Laravel community is simply unparalleled. There's a warmth, a friendliness that you just don't find anywhere else. It wasn't just my perspective—I saw developers from other ecosystems, like [@ThePrimeagen](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen), completely blown away by how welcoming everyone was. The Laravel community isn't just a group of people; it's a family that welcomes everyone with open arms.

Each talk was packed with value, and every conversation I had left me inspired and recharged. I found myself hopping from one discussion to another, connecting with developers I had admired for years, like [Caleb Porzio](https://twitter.com/calebporzio). We didn't even talk shop—no Livewire, no Alpine.js—just life and kids. It was surreal to discover how much we had in common, and it made me realize that Laracon isn't just about code; it's about the connections we make and the friendships we build.

## A week to remember

As I headed home, my mind was buzzing with all the ideas, insights, and conversations from the week. Laracon 2024 wasn't just a conference; it was a reminder of why I love being part of this community. It's not just the new products or the innovative packages; it's the shared passion, the genuine kindness, and the sense of belonging that make it all so special.

So, here's to another fantastic Laracon. I can't wait to do it all over again next year—minus the train ride with a bag full of coins, of course!
