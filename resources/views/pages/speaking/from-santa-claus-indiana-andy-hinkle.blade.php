            <div>In this episode, Kevin Kirchner interviews Andy Hinkle, a developer and founding member of the MVP Dev
                Podcast.
                <br /><br />Andy shares his journey from working at a theme park to becoming a web developer and his
                passion for minimal viable products (MVPs).
                <br /><br />They discuss the challenges of freelancing and the growing interest in AI.
                <br /><br />Andy emphasizes the importance of setting a clear finish line for MVPs and tackling the
                hardest problems first.
                <br /><br />The conversation focused on the importance of prioritizing the main problem and implementing
                a solution quickly. The concept of the four-week timeline for MVP development was discussed, with the
                idea that most problems can be streamlined and refined within that timeframe. Constraints were
                highlighted as a way to increase creativity and productivity. The role of design in simplifying and
                refining complex ideas was emphasized. The importance of user feedback and iterating based on that
                feedback was also discussed.
                <br /><br />The conversation concluded with a mention of the future of AI in website development and the
                need for niche and specialized solutions.
