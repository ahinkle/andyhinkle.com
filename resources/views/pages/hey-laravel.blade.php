            I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/andyhnk" class="text-blue-500/75" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Hinkle</a>
            and I'm a developer from Southern Indiana.

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            I'm excited to apply for the Technical Support Engineer position. My passion for helping others with my deep
            experience in Laravel and technical problem-solving, makes this role feel like the perfect fit.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            My journey with Laravel started about ten years ago, shortly
            after the release of Laravel 5.1. I have attended the past 4 Laracon US conferences. I've met so many great
            people and I've learned so much
            from the talks and getting to know the community.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            My first Laracon was in Chicago in 2018. It was at this moment I knew I wanted to be a part of this
            community. Everyone was so welcoming and I felt like I was a part of something special.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            Before becoming a developer, I started my career working in theme parks â€” it was my first job and I moved my
            way up through the ranks.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            Working at a theme park taught me lessons about customer service and collaborating with others. Iâ€™ve always
            loved helping people and solving problems, which is why Iâ€™m so passionate about Laravel â€“ it's all about
            solving problems and making developers' lives easier.

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            Here I am in the summer of 2014, training a supervisory team on how to safely evacuate a roller coaster in
            case of an emergency (yes, we were at the very top!) - Whether itâ€™s improving processes or streamlining
            solutions, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to find improvements to processes â€“ even if that means climbing to
            the top of a roller coaster!
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            When I was managing the team, I noticed we were doing many things by hand such as scheduling and tracking
            certifications, I decided to learn how to code so I could automate some of the tasks we were doing. I
            started with PHP and then I found Laravel. I've been hooked ever since.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            I taught myself how to code by building a Laravel application- with the help of
            <a href="https://laracasts.com/" class="text-blue-500/75" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffrey
                Way</a> of course. It was a huge success and saved us so much time. I enjoyed it so much that I decided
            to make a career change and become a full time developer.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            Today, I work as a senior developer at an agency called <a href="https://grayloon.com/"
                class="text-blue-500/75" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gray Loon Marketing Group</a>. I've
            worked on a variety of projects from small business websites to large enterprise applications.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            I'm here to serve customers. I work directly with both product and non-product owners to support their
            applications.
            I have hands-on experience with every Laravel commercial product and enjoy solving technical challenges.
            Here's how I've worked with each of them:
        </p>

        <ul class="grid list-inside gap-y-4 px-2 text-lg text-white">
            <li><a href="https://forge.laravel.com/" class="block text-blue-500/75" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Laravel Forge:</a>Managing over 50 sites on Forge, Iâ€™ve regularly tackled
                server-side issues like Nginx misconfigurations, SSL problems, and 502 errors.
                I enjoy diving deep into the server environment to debug and resolve these issues.</li>
            <li><a href="https://vapor.laravel.com/" class="block text-blue-500/75" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Laravel Vapor:</a>I manage an app with millions of monthly requests on
                Vapor, for which I am solely responsible. I'm an AWS Certified Practitioner and have experience with
                services like Lambda, SQS, and RDS.
                Iâ€™ve created custom CloudWatch dashboards for monitoring and performance tracking, closely resembling
                how Laravel Pulse functions.</li>

                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Laravel Spark:</a> I oversee multiple applications powered by Spark,
                primarily using Stripe, but have experience with Paddle as well.
                Iâ€™ve resolved complex issues with Stripe webhooks and ensured accurate invoicing for clients, always
                keeping payment processes smooth and reliable.</li>
            <li><a href="https://nova.laravel.com/" class="block text-blue-500/75" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Laravel Nova:</a>Iâ€™ve been a proud Nova user since day one, witnessing its
                launch in Chicago.
                Iâ€™ve pushed Novaâ€™s customization capabilities to it's limits, contributed to its documentation, and
                built custom tools to extend its functionality for different projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            I love discovering new things and sharing knowledge with others. When I come across something
            undocumented, I see it as an opportunity to give back to the community and teach others. I've contributed
            around 50 accepted PRs to the Laravel documentation - here are a few examples:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-inside list-disc text-lg text-white">
            <li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/docs/pull/9141" class="text-blue-500/75" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">[10.x] Add Number Utility, #9141</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/docs/pull/9118" class="text-blue-500/75" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">[10.x] Add assertBatchCount(), assertNothingBatched(), #9118</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/docs/pull/9223" class="text-blue-500/75" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">[10.x] Session Blade Directive, #9223</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            I've also made several contributions to the Laravel framework:
        </p>

        <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/30653" class="text-lg text-blue-500/75" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">[6.x] Allow explicit Model definitions in database rules, #30653</a>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            Previously, we could only use validation rules with the qualifying database table. With this accepted PR, it
            allowed the use of the model name instead of the table name. This was a great quality-of-life improvement
            for developers.
        </p>

        <pre class="-mt-4">
        <x-torchlight-code language='php'>
        // Before
        $request->validate([
            'email' => 'unique:users,email_address',
        ]);

        // After
        $request->validate([
            'name' => 'unique:App\Models\User,email_address',
        ]);
        </x-torchlight-code>
        </pre>

        <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/45153" class="-mt-10 text-lg text-blue-500/75"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[9.x] Add Policies to Model Show Command #45153</a>

        <p class="-mt-4 text-lg text-white">
            This PR added the ability to show policies for a model when using the
            <code class="rounded-md bg-gray-900 p-1 text-sm text-white">php artisan model:show</code> command
            . This helped developers understand the policies that were associated with a model.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white">
            When I saw the Technical Support Engineer position, it felt like the perfect opportunity to combine my love
            for Laravel, helping others, and solving problems. I'm excited about the chance to support both the
            community and the team.
