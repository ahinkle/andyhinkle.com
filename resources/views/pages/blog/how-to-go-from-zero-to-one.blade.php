            The idea of working in public, putting yourself and
            your work out there for the world to see, stirs up every insecurity you’ve ever had. It makes you question
            everything.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4 italic">
            Who am I to do this?
            <span class="block mt-2">
                Hasn't this been done a hundred times before?
            </span>
            <span class="block mt-2">
                Am I just copying what already exists?
            </span>
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            For a long time, I've been thinking about this idea of starting a new podcast—yes, another one. I know what
            you’re thinking:
            <a href="https://andyhinkle.com/blog/we-started-a-podcast" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500 italic">
                You just started one!</a>
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            But this is different— I want to talk to developers, dive deep into their stories. I want to know where they
            come from, what pulled them into the world of Laravel, what keeps them excited about writing code, and how
            they get their ideas out into the world.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            When I shared this idea with a few well-known developers, they were all in. They want to be part of it, and
            that’s both exhilarating and terrifying.
            Their interest is validation—but also pressure. Now, it’s real.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            And now I’m stuck at the hardest part:
            <span class="italic">
                going from zero to one.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            Starting anything from scratch is like staring at a blank page, knowing the first word has to be written but
            feeling like nothing you put down is good enough.
            My perfectionist brain wants everything to be flawless before I even hit record.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4 italic">
            What about the intro music?
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4 italic">
            What about the logo?
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4 italic">
            What about the show format?
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            What if the first episode flops? I'm obsessing over episode one when I know deep down that episode two,
            three, four—those will be easier. The momentum will come. But that first step? It feels like jumping off a
            cliff.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            That's the thing no one tells you about starting. We talk about overcoming fear, but we rarely talk about
            how that fear feels when you're in the middle of it. We sugarcoat it. Just do it. But it's not that simple.
            The doubts are loud, and they’ll get louder the closer you get to launching.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            I'm not scared of failure.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            I don't care if people don't like the show.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            What is do care about is the people who <span class="italic">want</span> to listen. I want this show to
            resonate with them and have meaning. It's for them. I want to create something that adds value—something
            thoughtful and intentional—rather than something that merely fills space or wastes time.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            I want to create something that matters to those people.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            How do you go from zero to one? You don’t overthink it. You don’t wait until it feels perfect, because it
            never will. You jump, even if you’re terrified, even if you don’t know what’s on the other side. You do it
            because the alternative—staying at zero—is far worse.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            If you're reading this and you've been thinking about starting something new, I hope you take that first
            step. I hope you push past the fear and the doubt. Feel free to reach out if you need some encouragement.
            I’m here for you.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            And if you’re interested in being a guest on the show, let me know. I’d love to chat with you.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white/85 text-lg text-left mt-4">
            Cheers.
