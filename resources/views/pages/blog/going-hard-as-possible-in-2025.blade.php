            It’s 2025, and I’m done holding back.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/85">
            For the past few years,
            <a href="https://aaronfrancis.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="underline">Aaron
                Francis</a> has been a quiet force in my life—his approach to work and life feels electric.
            Phrases like <span class="italic">“You can just do things”</span> and <span class="italic">“What if you
                just tried really, really hard?”</span> aren’t just words for him. They’re a challenge. A call to
            action. He even named his company <a href="https://tryhardstudios.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                target="_blank" class="underline">Try Hard
                Studios</a>, as if to
            underscore the point: effort isn’t just an idea; it’s a way of living.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/85">
            And yet, I’ve let hesitation fill. There’s a constant thought in the back of my head: “Why
            bother? Someone’s already done this. It won’t matter.” That voice has stopped me in my tracks more times
            than I’d like to admit. It’s crept into my work, my ideas, even my personal life.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/85">
            It’s that moment when you
            have an idea for a side project but immediately dismiss it because the market feels saturated. Or when you
            think about sharing a thought or piece of work online and stop, fearing criticism or indifference. Even in
            personal decisions—like reaching out to an old friend or signing up for something new—that same doubt
            lingers: “What if it’s not worth it? What if I’m not good enough?” It’s easier to sit on the sidelines,
            wrapped in the safety of inaction, than to risk failing in public.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/85">
            But then there are those moments that snap things into perspective. Like when
            someone said to me, “You’re going to miss picking up your kids’ LEGO blocks one day.” That hit me. Those
            little moments are the ones that slip through your fingers the fastest. It’s not just about doing
            the big things; it’s about being fully present in the small ones.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/85">
            Aaron <a href="https://aaronfrancis.com/2024/what-if-you-tried-hard-dac139a5" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                target="_blank" class="underline">
                once wrote</a> about the stigma around trying hard. He pointed out how people avoid effort because of
            the fear of looking like they care too much. Cool kids don’t try; they just float effortlessly from one
            success to another. Except, that’s a myth. Watch any documentary about someone great—a Lionel Messi, a
            Taylor Swift, a Kobe Bryant—and what stands out is how hard they worked. These aren’t stories of coasting;
            they’re stories of grit, of putting in extra hours when no one was watching, of trying harder than anyone
            else around them.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/85">
            This year, I’m done with the hesitation. I’m saying yes—to ideas, to opportunities, to messes, to diving
            deeper into podcasts, to showing up more in the Laravel community, to hugging my kids longer, to writing
            that blog post that’s been stuck in my head, and to taking on challenges that scare me. Especially to hugs.
            I’m going to try hard at being present with my family, even when I’m exhausted. I’ll try hard to tackle
            projects that feel daunting. Even when it’s uncomfortable or uncertain, I’m going all in. Because maybe
            Aaron’s right: what if I just tried really, really hard?
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/85">
            Trying hard doesn’t mean perfection. It doesn’t mean success every time. It means putting weight behind the
            things that matter, both big and small. It means silencing the voice that asks, “Why bother?” and replacing
            it with one that says, “Why not?”
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-white/85">
            So here’s to 2025. Here’s to going hard as possible. Here’s to trying, failing, and trying again. Here’s to
            being fully present in the moments that matter. Here’s to saying yes.
