            We often find comfort in the familiar. The frameworks, libraries, and patterns we've used for years become
            our go-to tools.
            However, this comfort can sometimes turn into a reluctance to explore new packages or patterns, leading to
            missed opportunities for growth and innovation.

            When faced with a new technology or pattern that makes you feel uncomfortable, <span class="font-bold">just

            Tailwind CSS
        </h2>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            When I first heard about Tailwind CSS, I was skeptical. The idea of writing inline styles in my HTML felt
            wrong, and I dismissed it as a fad that would soon pass.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            I never gave it a fair chance. I quickly dismissed it because it made me feel uncomfortable.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            However, after seeing the positive feedback from other developers who absolutely loved it, I decided to give
            it a try.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            I was wrong.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            Tailwind CSS has become my go-to tool for styling web applications. It has allowed me to build beautiful,
            responsive designs quickly and efficiently, and I can't imagine going back to traditional CSS.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            Initially, my team was reluctant to use it. They were comfortable with their existing tools (e.g. SASS) and
            didn't see the value in trying something new.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            I didn't push the issue -- However, for new greenfield projects I started sprinkling in bits of Tailwind.
            After seeing the positive result and contributing to the project, other team members started to see the
            value in it and adopted it as well.

            I'm a moderator at <a href="https://reddit.com/r/laravel" class="text-blue-500/75">/r/laravel</a>, and I can
            assure you that when a new package or pattern is introduced, there are always naysayers who dismiss it
            without giving it a fair chance.

            There will always be detractors who are quick to label new tools as "bad" or "wrong" because they don't fit
            their existing mental model.

            Ignore these voices and form your own opinions based on your experiences and the feedback from <span

            PestPHP
        </h2>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            I was first introduced to PestPHP at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkDMDHAs09U" target="_blank"

            in a talk by Nuno Maduro. I was intrigued by the syntax and the promise of faster, more readable tests, but
            I was skeptical.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            I was with a co-worker and we both just didn't get it. We were comfortable with PHPUnit and didn't see the
            value in trying something new.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            It felt like semantic sugar, and I didn't see the value in it. I didn't give it a chance and was quick to
            dismiss it.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            However, I kept seeing positive feedback from other developers and thought, "What the heck, I'll give it a
            try."
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            I was wrong.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            PestPHP is incredibly clean, like a breath of fresh air. What I didn't realize initially is that it's more
            than just semantics. It's easier to read and write, and I found myself writing tests faster than ever
            before.

            So Just Try It
        </h2>

        <p class="mt-4 text-balance text-left text-lg text-white/85 md:text-wrap">
            Get your hands dirty. If something makes you feel uncomfortable, just try it. You may find that it opens up
            new possibilities and ways of thinking that you hadn't considered before. Don't be so dismissive even if it
            feels wrong.
