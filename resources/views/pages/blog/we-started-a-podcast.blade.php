                McCleery</a> and I have had countless deep-dive conversations over Slack about Laravel, PHP, and all
            things web development. We've been toying with the idea of starting a podcast for a while now, and we
            finally made it happen!

            Introducing <a href="https://the-midwest-artisan.transistor.fm/" class="italic text-blue-400 underline"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Midwest Artisan</a> – a podcast where we explore the world
            of Laravel and web development, and share the knowledge we've gathered over the past decade.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-wrap text-left text-lg text-white/85">
            Laravel has always been a passion of ours, and we've been fortunate to be part of such a vibrant and
            welcoming community. Through The Midwest Artisan, we want to give back by sharing our experiences, tips, and
            successes with others who share our love for this incredible framework.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-wrap text-left text-lg text-white/85">
            In each episode, we’ll dive into topics like Laravel, PHP, web development, and more. You can expect
            practical tips, insights from our projects, and even some guest appearances from fellow developers. Our goal
            is to inspire and contribute to the Laravel community that has given us so much.
